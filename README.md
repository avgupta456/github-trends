## What is GitHub Trends

GitHub Trends dives deep into the GitHub API to bring you exciting and impactful metrics about your code contributions. Generate insights on lines written by language, repository, and time. Easily embed dynamic images into your GitHub profile to share your statistics with the world. Check out some of the examples below:

And voila, you get a card like above. Keep reading to learn more!

## Why GitHub Trends?

Unlike other projects which look at just your public repositories, GitHub Trends computes metrics based on your individual commits. If you commit to open-source projects, or have collaborators contribute to your own repositories, GitHub Trends will better measure your own code contributions. Through this method, GitHub Trends is the first project that allows users to surface lines of code written (LOC) by language and repository. Our web interface also allows for easier customization.
